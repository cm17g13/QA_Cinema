                <h3> A bit about QA Cinema</h3> <br>

                <h5>Founded back in 2005, QA Cinemas is one of the largest cinema  company in the world. We are currently expanding and aim to offer our services to more viewers and more cities around the world. We have host the latest and hottest movies out.
                    We give our viewers the best cinema experiences ever and aim for viewers to have the best user experience possible.
                    Today we are owned by QA, the UK's leading IT training provider, with over 1500 IT and project management courses including Microsoft, Cisco, VMware, PRINCE2 and many more.
                    We’re determined to give every guest a great experience every time they visit, and so continuously strive to innovate and improve our hospitality and services.
                    We have always been at the forefront of cinematic experience: both IMAX and ISENSE offer extraordinary cinema viewing, and we also operate London’s BFI IMAX which is the largest cinema screen in the UK. We have the UK’s biggest cinema loyalty scheme - QA Associates Club - with over 1 million members.
                    We also offer so much more than popcorn and soft drinks. We now have Costa Coffee in many of our cinemas, a superb cocktail lounge called Surfs-Up at some sites and gallery offering unlimited popcorn, nachos and soft drinks in other locations.
                    If you want to indulge yourself in a sensational experience, visit one of our cinemas today.
